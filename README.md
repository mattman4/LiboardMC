# LiboardMC
Connects to a Lichess game in Minecraft by sending a challenge request to a hardcoded opponent. The board is reflected via mobs on a Minecraft recreation of a chess board with pieces being different mobs. Each turn, a sign GUI comes up asking you to input a move which updates the Lichess board as well as the Minecraft board.
